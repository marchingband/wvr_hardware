The build at JLCPCB is successful using SURFACE FINISH = ENIG-RoHS.
(this is more pricey but this ensure U3: eMMC to be soldered correctly).

Here are the parameters I used:
Base Material: FR-4
Layers: 2
PCB Thickness: 1.6
Surface Finish: ENIG-RoHS
Deburring/Edge rounding: No
Outer Copper Weight: 1
Gold Fingers: No
Flying Probe Test: Fully Test
Castellated Holes: no
Remove Order Number: No
Material Type: FR4-Standard Tg 130-140C

GERBER = WVR_GERBER.zip
BOM = wvr_v.1.0.csv
CPL (placement) = wvr_v.1.0-top-pos.csv

During SMT order process, parts placement review may show at a wrong scale (itâ€™s a bug from JLC).
Part orientations are all correct.

GOOD LUCK!
